## Use
The theme uses the Builder pattern for defining primary, secondary and accent colors.
See
`DarkMaterialSwingTheme.builder()`
and
`LightMaterialSwingTheme.builder()`.
The primary colour should be a grey tone for each theme.

If only primary1 is specified (the first primary color), defaults are chosen for the others, based on primary1.

Example:
`MetalLookAndFeel.setCurrentTheme(DarkMaterialSwingTheme.builder().withPrimary1(new ColorUIResource(62, 62, 62).withAccent1(new ColorUIResource(0, 120, 255)).withAccent2(new ColorUIResource(Color.GREEN)).build());`
